* About
Temperature in Dhaka city, Bangladesh is rampant. A core reason is a severe lack of vegetation. Whereas a city should have 25% vegetation areas, we only have 7%.
And the temperature is an all time high.

* Plan
[[https://github.com/abj-paul/Mapping-Plantation-Areas-in-Bangladesh.git][We first downloaded satellite data from this open source site.]] We will now estimate ~Normalized Vegetation Index~. Thus we will find areas where we have plantation. Then we will identify areas where we can plant trees.

WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR COLLABORATION.
