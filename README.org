WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR COLLABORATION.

* About
Temperature in Dhaka city, Bangladesh is rampant. A core reason is a severe lack of vegetation. Whereas a city should have 25% vegetation areas, we only have 7%.
And the temperature is an all time high.

* Progress
[[https://github.com/abj-paul/Mapping-Plantation-Areas-in-Bangladesh.git][We first downloaded satellite data from this open source site.]] After downloading the satellite data, extract them using:
#+begin_src bash
  tar -xvf LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1.tar
#+end_src
Note that, B4(Band 4) is the red band and B5(Band 5) is the NIR band. We will need them to calculate NDVI.

We will now estimate ~Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)~. Thus we will find areas where we have plantation. Then we will identify areas where we can plant trees. We consider NDVI values > ~0.35~ as plant areas according to the chart below.

[[file:res/NDVI-values-for-different-features.png]]

We found the following vegetation index for different areas in Bangladesh.
| Area         | Percentage of Plantation Areas |
|--------------+--------------------------------|
| Shanir Akhra |                          9.03% |

And the areas that have vegetation in Shanir Akhra are:

This looks like "Dholair Khal" instead of vegetation, interesting.


We basically neet to do ~Landcover mapping~ and ~vegetation index map~, as shown in [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319122657_Soil_and_Water_Conservation_Prioritization_Using_Geospatial_Technology_-_a_Case_Study_of_Part_of_Subarnarekha_Basin_Jharkhand_India/figures?lo=1][this paper.]]
