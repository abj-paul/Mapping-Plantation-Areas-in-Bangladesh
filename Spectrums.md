The bands in a Landsat-8 Level-2 Surface Reflectance product contain information about different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Here's a brief explanation of each band:

1. **Band 1 (Coastal/Aerosol) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B1.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the blue portion of the spectrum (0.43 - 0.45 μm).
   - It is used for detecting water quality, aerosols, and coastal features.

2. **Band 2 (Blue) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B2.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the blue portion of the spectrum (0.45 - 0.51 μm).
   - It is used for atmospheric corrections and detecting water bodies.

3. **Band 3 (Green) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B3.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the green portion of the spectrum (0.53 - 0.59 μm).
   - It is used for vegetation monitoring and land cover classification.

4. **Band 4 (Red) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B4.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the red portion of the spectrum (0.64 - 0.67 μm).
   - It is used for vegetation health assessment, soil moisture estimation, and land cover mapping.

5. **Band 5 (Near-Infrared) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B5.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum (0.85 - 0.88 μm).
   - It is used for vegetation health assessment, land cover mapping, and monitoring drought conditions.

6. **Band 6 (Short-Wave Infrared 1) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B6.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the short-wave infrared portion of the spectrum (1.57 - 1.65 μm).
   - It is used for soil moisture estimation, geological mapping, and vegetation stress assessment.

7. **Band 7 (Short-Wave Infrared 2) - LC09_L2SP_137043_20240402_20240403_02_T1_SR_B7.TIF**:
   - This band captures data in the short-wave infrared portion of the spectrum (2.11 - 2.29 μm).
   - It is used for geological mapping, land cover classification, and vegetation health assessment.

These bands provide valuable information for various applications such as agriculture, forestry, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.
